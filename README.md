Welcome to the official website for our Master’s project in Computer Engineering at the University of Utah. 

We, Daniel and Norman, are graduate students pursuing advanced studies in this discipline. A cornerstone of the curriculum at the University of Utah is the rigorous exploration of Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI), a field of such significance that the institution provides its students with the unique opportunity to design and fabricate integrated circuit chips. Central to this endeavor is the verification of chip functionality through robust testing protocols. Regrettably, the existing testing apparatus at the university suffers from obsolescence, rendering replacement components nearly unattainable, or exhibits excessive operational complexity, impeding efficient use. 

Motivated by these challenges, our Master’s project seeks to develop an innovative chip tester designed to be both cost-effective and user-friendly. Key features of the proposed system include:
- Real-time testing capabilities to ensure immediate performance evaluation.
- "Schmoo" plotting functionality, enabling comprehensive characterization across voltage and frequency domains.
