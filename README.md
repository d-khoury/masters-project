Welcome to our computer engineering masters project website! Daniel and Norman
are computer engineering masters students at the University of Utah. One of the
important subjects of study st the University of Utah is VLSI (very large circuit 
integration). So important that the university gives it students the opportunity 
design and fabricate a integrated circuit chip. In important part of this process 
is to test these chips an to see if they function properly. The testers they have 
at the school to do this are either so old that it is virtually impossible to find 
replacement parts or it is very complicated to use. For these reasons our masters 
project is to design a tester that will be cheeper and easier to use. Some of the 
features are:

<ul>
	<li>	Real Time Testing.</li>
	<li>	Schmooing both Voltage and Frequency.
</ul
