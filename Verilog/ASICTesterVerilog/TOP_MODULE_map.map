Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:1186 - One or more I/O components have conflicting property values.
    For each occurrence, the system will use the property value attached to the
   pad.  Otherwise, the system will use the first property value read.  To view
   each occurrence, create a detailed map report (run map using the -detail
   option).

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,678 out of   2,278   73%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        56 out of   4,556    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,605

      to control set restrictions:              68 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
