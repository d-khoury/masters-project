Norm/Daniel:
1) Generating clocks from FPGA code. [In progress]
	- ODDRs and phase differences.
	- 555 timer and external PLL as contigency plan.

Norm:
1) Investigate scripts for communication.
- Write files.
- Copy files.
- Delete files.ive
- SSH login/exit.

Daniel:
1) Basic client/server model using computer, BBB, and copying files between each other.
2) Think about building a power circuit PCB.
