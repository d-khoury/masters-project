Using a value of R1 = 490 ohms and this equation:

R2 = R1*((Vout/Vref) - 1)

Where Vref = 1.25V (equation taken from the datasheet).

R2 should be 1470 ohms to get an output of 5V.
Setting R2 to that value produces an output of 5.03V.

R2 should be 1274 ohms to get an output of 4.5V.
Setting R2 to that value produces an output of 4.49V.

So far, things are looking good!
