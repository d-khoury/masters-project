\section{Overview of ASIC Testers}
All ASIC testers build upon the same simple idea: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The user specifies what outputs to expect from their chip in response to what inputs.
\item The system applies the user-specified inputs to the device under test (DUT) and later samples the outputs of the DUT.
\item The machine reports how the sampled outputs compare to the outputs expected by the user.
\end{enumerate}

In this section, we provide an abstracted overview of how the Tektronix LV500 implements the above steps. Although we are not familiar with the implementation of other ASIC testers, like the Verigy 93000, we believe that an understanding the LV500's implementation does well to sprout relatable ideas. 

\textbf{NOTE}: More detailed information about the LV500's physical implementation can be found \href{https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=http://www.ece.utah.edu/~kstevens/6712/tester.ppt}{here}. We chose to abstract away  some of the details in these slides that we deemed irrelevant for this section.
